<a href="https://cafereactapi.herokuapp.com/" ><h1> React Cafe API </h1></a>

This API uses Express, Mongoose and JWT.

This is the Backend End API half of my MERN App which is a social media protoype with full Authentication and Authorization.

This uses Mongodb as the database and uses JWT Tokens for the AUTH system.

Some of the public routes are : /cafe , /cafe/links, /users
