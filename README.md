<a href="https://cafereactapi.herokuapp.com/" ><h1> React Cafe API </h1></a>

This API uses Express, Mongoose and JWT.

This is the Backend End API half of my MERN App which is a social media protoype with full Authentication and Authorization.

This uses Mongodb as the database and uses JWT Tokens for the AUTH system.

The API is limited to 200 requests and then a time out of 2 minutes.

Some of the public routes are : /cafe , /cafe/links, /users.
